                          Configuring your Network

   a. Automatic Network Detection

   Maybe it just works?

   If your system is plugged into an Ethernet network with a DHCP server, it
   is very likely that your networking configuration has already been set up
   automatically for you. If so, you should be able to take advantage of the
   many included network-aware commands on the Installation CD such as ssh,
   scp, ping, irssi, wget and links, among others.

   If networking has been configured for you, the /sbin/ifconfig command
   should list some network interfaces besides lo, such as eth0:

   Code Listing 1: /sbin/ifconfig for a working network configuration         
   # /sbin/ifconfig                                                           
   (...)                                                                      
   eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:50:BA:8F:61:7A                    
             inet addr:192.168.0.2  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0   
             inet6 addr: fe80::50:ba8f:617a/10 Scope:Link                     
             UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1               
             RX packets:1498792 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0         
             TX packets:1284980 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0       
             collisions:1984 txqueuelen:100                                   
             RX bytes:485691215 (463.1 Mb)  TX bytes:123951388 (118.2 Mb)     
             Interrupt:11 Base address:0xe800                                 

   Optional: Configure any Proxies

   If you access the Internet through a proxy, you might need to set up proxy
   information during the installation. It is very easy to define a proxy:
   you just need to define a variable which contains the proxy server
   information.

   In most cases, you can just define the variables using the server
   hostname. As an example, we assume the proxy is called proxy.gentoo.org
   and the port is 8080.

   Code Listing 2: Defining proxy servers                                     
   (If the proxy filters HTTP traffic)                                        
   # export http_proxy="http://proxy.gentoo.org:8080"                         
   (If the proxy filters FTP traffic)                                         
   # export ftp_proxy="ftp://proxy.gentoo.org:8080"                           
   (If the proxy filters RSYNC traffic)                                       
   # export RSYNC_PROXY="proxy.gentoo.org:8080"                               

   If your proxy requires a username and password, you should use the
   following syntax for the variable:

   Code Listing 3: Adding username/password to the proxy variable             
   http://username:password@proxy.gentoo.org:8080                             

   Testing the Network

   You may want to try pinging your ISP's DNS server (found in
   /etc/resolv.conf) and a Web site of your choice, just to make sure that
   your packets are reaching the net, DNS name resolution is working
   correctly, etc.

   Code Listing 4: Further network testing                                    
   # ping -c 3 www.yahoo.com                                                  

   If you are now able to use your network, you can skip the rest of this
   document. If not, read on.

   b. Automatic Network Configuration

   If the network doesn't work immediately, some installation media allow you
   to use net-setup (for regular or wireless networks), adsl-setup (for
   ADSL-users) or pptp (for PPTP-users - only available on x86).

   If your installation medium does not contain any of these tools or your
   network doesn't function yet, continue with Manual Network Configuration.

     * Regular Ethernet users should continue with Default: Using net-setup
     * ADSL users should continue with Alternative: Using RP-PPPoE
     * PPTP users should continue with Alternative: Using PPTP
     * Speedtouch USB users should continue with Alternative: Using Speedtouch
       USB

   Default: Using net-setup

   The simplest way to set up networking if it didn't get configured
   automatically is to run the net-setup script:

   Code Listing 5: Running the net-setup script                               
   # net-setup eth0                                                           

   net-setup will ask you some questions about your network environment. When
   all is done, you should have a working network connection. Test your
   network connection as stated before. If the tests are positive,
   congratulations! You are now ready to install Gentoo and can skip the 
   rest of this document.

   If your network still doesn't work, continue with Manual Network
   Configuration.

   Alternative: Using RP-PPPoE

   Assuming you need PPPoE to connect to the internet, the Installation CD
   (any version) has made things easy for you by including rp-pppoe. Use the
   provided adsl-setup script to configure your connection. You will be
   prompted for the ethernet device that is connected to your adsl modem,
   your username and password, the IPs of your DNS servers and if you need a
   basic firewall or not.

   Code Listing 6: Using rp-pppoe                                             
   # adsl-setup                                                               
   # adsl-start                                                               

   If something goes wrong, double-check that you correctly typed your
   username and password by looking at /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or
   /etc/ppp/chap-secrets and make sure you are using the right ethernet
   device. If your ethernet device doesn't exist, you will have to load the
   appropriate network modules. In that case you should continue with Manual
   Network Configuration as we explain how to load the appropriate network
   modules there.

   If everything worked, continue with Preparing the Disks.

   Alternative: Using PPTP

   Note: PPTP support is only available for x86                               

   If you need PPTP support, you can use pptpclient which is provided by our
   Installation CDs. But first you need to make sure that your configuration
   is correct. Edit /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets so it
   contains the correct username/password combination:

   Code Listing 7: Editing /etc/ppp/chap-secrets                              
   # nano -w /etc/ppp/chap-secrets                                            

   Then adjust /etc/ppp/options.pptp if necessary:

   Code Listing 8: Editing /etc/ppp/options.pptp                              
   # nano -w /etc/ppp/options.pptp                                            

   When all that is done, just run pptp (along with the options you couldn't
   set in options.pptp) to connect the server:

   Code Listing 9: Connection to a dial-in server                             
   # pptp <server ip>                                                         

   Now continue with Preparing the Disks.

   Alternative: Using Speedtouch USB

   First, you need to help hotplug in finding the Alcatel Speedtouch USB
   modem. Add the following line to /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap:

   Code Listing 10: Adding Alcatel Speedtouch support
   speedtouch 0x0003 0x06b9 0x4061 0x0000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00000000 "Alcatel SpeedTouch USB"
   
   Next, create /etc/ppp/peers/adsl and enter the following information:

   Code Listing 11: Editing /etc/ppp/peers/adsl
   noipdefault
   defaultroute
   # Change this to the login for your ISP.
   user "user@provider.com"
   passive
   persist
   holdoff 4
   maxfail 25
   plugin pppoatm.so
   # Changes by country - http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/faq/index.html#q12
   0.38
   
   If your ISP provides the name servers, add "usepeerdns" to it as well.

   Now add your login and password to the /etc/ppp/chap-secrets file:

   Code Listing 12: Setting the user name and password
   "user@provider.com"  *  "yourpassword"

   Now you are all set: start up your internet connection using pppd:

   Code Listing 13: Starting the Internet connection
   # pppd call adsl
   
   c. Manual Network Configuration

   Loading the Appropriate Network Modules

   When the Installation CD boots, it tries to detect all your hardware
   devices and loads the appropriate kernel modules (drivers) to support your
   hardware. In the vast majority of cases, it does a very good job. However,
   in some cases, it may not auto-load the kernel modules you need.

   If net-setup or adsl-setup failed, then it is possible that your network
   card wasn't found immediately. This means you may have to load the
   appropriate kernel modules manually.

   To find out what kernel modules we provide for networking, use ls:

   Code Listing 14: Searching for provided modules                            
   # ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net                            

   If you find a driver for your network card, use modprobe to load the
   kernel module:

   Code Listing 15: Using modprobe to load a kernel module                    
   (As an example, we load the pcnet32 module)                                
   # modprobe pcnet32                                                         

   To check if your network card is now detected, use ifconfig. A detected
   network card would result in something like this:

   Code Listing 16: Testing availability of your network card, successful     
   # ifconfig eth0                                                            
   eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr FE:FD:00:00:00:00                    
             BROADCAST NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1                    
             RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0               
             TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0             
             collisions:0 txqueuelen:0                                        
             RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)                           

   If however you receive the following error, the network card is not
   detected:

   Code Listing 17: Testing availability of your network card, failed         
   # ifconfig eth0                                                            
   eth0: error fetching interface information: Device not found               

   If you have multiple network cards in your system they are named eth0,
   eth1, etc. Make sure that the network card you want to use works well and
   remember to use the correct naming throughout this document. We will
   assume that the network card eth0 is used.

   Assuming that you now have a detected network card, you can retry
   net-setup or adsl-setup again (which should work now), but for the
   hardcore people amongst you we explain how to configure your network
   manually.

   Select one of the following sections based on your network setup:

     * Using DHCP for automatic IP retrieval
     * Preparing for Wireless Access if you have a wireless card
     * Understanding Network Terminology explains what you need to know about
       networking
     * Using ifconfig and route explains how to set up your networking
       manually

   Using DHCP

   DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) makes it possible to
   automatically receive networking information (IP address, netmask,
   broadcast address, gateway, nameservers etc.). This only works if you have
   a DHCP server in your network (or if your provider provides a DHCP
   service). To have a network interface receive this information
   automatically, use dhcpcd:

   Code Listing 18: Using dhcpcd                                              
   # dhcpcd eth0                                                              
   Some network admins require that you use the                               
   hostname and domainname provided by the DHCP server.                       
   In that case, use                                                          
   # dhcpcd -HD eth0                                                          

   If this works (try pinging some internet server, like Google), then you
   are all set and ready to continue. Skip the rest of this section and
   continue with Preparing the Disks.

   Preparing for Wireless Access

   Note: Support for the iwconfig command is only available on x86, amd64 and 
   ppc Installation CDs. You can still get the extensions working otherwise   
   by following the instructions of the linux-wlan-ng project.                

   If you are using a wireless (802.11) card, you may need to configure your
   wireless settings before going any further. To see the current wireless
   settings on your card, you can use iwconfig. Running iwconfig might show
   something like:

Code Listing 19: Showing the current wireless settings                           
# iwconfig eth0                                                                  
eth0      IEEE 802.11-DS  ESSID:"GentooNode"                                     
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.442GHz  Access Point: 00:09:5B:11:CC:F2      
          Bit Rate:11Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   Sensitivity=0/65535                
          Retry limit:16   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off                        
          Power Management:off                                                   
          Link Quality:25/10  Signal level:-51 dBm  Noise level:-102 dBm         
          Rx invalid nwid:5901 Rx invalid crypt:0 Rx invalid frag:0 Tx           
          excessive retries:237 Invalid misc:350282 Missed beacon:84             

   Note: Some wireless cards may have a device name of wlan0 or ra0 instead   
   of eth0. Run iwconfig without any command-line parameters to determine the 
   correct device name.                                                       

   For most users, there are only two settings that might be important to
   change, the ESSID (aka wireless network name) or the WEP key. If the ESSID
   and Access Point address listed are already that of your access point and
   you are not using WEP, then your wireless is working. If you need to
   change your ESSID, or add a WEP key, you can issue the following commands:

   Code Listing 20: Changing ESSID and/or adding WEP key                      
   (This sets the network name to "GentooNode")                               
   # iwconfig eth0 essid GentooNode                                           
                                                                              
   (This sets a hex WEP key)                                                  
   # iwconfig eth0 key 1234123412341234abcd                                   
                                                                              
   (This sets an ASCII key - prefix it with "s:")                             
   # iwconfig eth0 key s:some-password                                        

   You can then confirm your wireless settings again by using iwconfig. Once
   you have wireless working, you can continue configuring the IP level
   networking options as described in the next section (Understanding Network
   Terminology) or use the net-setup tool as described previously.

   Understanding Network Terminology

   Note: If you know your IP address, broadcast address, netmask and          
   nameservers, then you can skip this subsection and continue with Using     
   ifconfig and route.                                                        

   If all of the above fails, you will have to configure your network
   manually. This is not difficult at all. However, you need to be familiar
   with some network terminology, as you will need it to be able to configure
   your network to your satisfaction. After reading this, you will know what
   a gateway is, what a netmask serves for, how a broadcast address is formed
   and why you need nameservers.

   In a network, hosts are identified by their IP address (Internet Protocol
   address). Such an address is a combination of four numbers between 0 and
   255. Well, at least that is how we perceive it. In reality, such an IP
   address consists of 32 bits (ones and zeros). Let's view an example:

   Code Listing 21: Example of an IP address                                  
   IP Address (numbers):   192.168.0.2                                        
   IP Address (bits):      11000000 10101000 00000000 00000010                
                           -------- -------- -------- --------                
                              192      168       0        2                   

   Such an IP address is unique to a host as far as all accessible networks
   are concerned (i.e. every host that you are able to reach must have a
   unique IP address). In order to distinguish between hosts inside and
   outside a network, the IP address is divided in two parts: the network
   part and the host part.

   The separation is written down with the netmask, a collection of ones
   followed by a collection of zeros. The part of the IP that can be mapped
   on the ones is the network-part, the other one is the host-part. As usual,
   the netmask can be written down as an IP-address.

   Code Listing 22: Example of network/host separation                        
   IP-address:    192      168      0         2                               
               11000000 10101000 00000000 00000010                            
   Netmask:    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000                            
                  255      255     255        0                               
              +--------------------------+--------+                           
                       Network              Host                              

   In other words, 192.168.0.14 is still part of our example network, but
   192.168.1.2 is not.

   The broadcast address is an IP-address with the same network-part as your
   network, but with only ones as host-part. Every host on your network
   listens to this IP address. It is truly meant for broadcasting packets.

   Code Listing 23: Broadcast address                                         
   IP-address:    192      168      0         2                               
               11000000 10101000 00000000 00000010                            
   Broadcast:  11000000 10101000 00000000 11111111                            
                  192      168      0        255                              
              +--------------------------+--------+                           
                        Network             Host                              

   To be able to surf on the internet, you must know which host shares the
   Internet connection. This host is called the gateway. Since it is a
   regular host, it has a regular IP address (for instance 192.168.0.1).

   We previously stated that every host has its own IP address. To be able to
   reach this host by a name (instead of an IP address) you need a service
   that translates a name (such as dev.gentoo.org) to an IP address (such as
   64.5.62.82). Such a service is called a name service. To use such a
   service, you must define the necessary name servers in /etc/resolv.conf.

   In some cases, your gateway also serves as nameserver. Otherwise you will
   have to enter the nameservers provided by your ISP.

   To summarise, you will need the following information before continuing:

   Network Item    Example                        
   Your IP address 192.168.0.2                    
   Netmask         255.255.255.0                  
   Broadcast       192.168.0.255                  
   Gateway         192.168.0.1                    
   Nameserver(s)   195.130.130.5, 195.130.130.133 

   Using ifconfig and route

   Setting up your network consists of three steps. First we assign ourselves
   an IP address using ifconfig. Then we set up routing to the gateway using
   route. Then we finish up by placing the nameserver IPs in
   /etc/resolv.conf.

   To assign an IP address, you will need your IP address, broadcast address
   and netmask. Then execute the following command, substituting ${IP_ADDR}
   with your IP address, ${BROADCAST} with your broadcast address and
   ${NETMASK} with your netmask:

   Code Listing 24: Using ifconfig                                            
   # ifconfig eth0 ${IP_ADDR} broadcast ${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK} up    

   Now set up routing using route. Substitute ${GATEWAY} with your gateway IP
   address:

   Code Listing 25: Using route                                               
   # route add default gw ${GATEWAY}                                          

   Now open /etc/resolv.conf with your favorite editor (in our example, we
   use nano):

   Code Listing 26: Creating /etc/resolv.conf                                 
   # nano -w /etc/resolv.conf                                                 

   Now fill in your nameserver(s) using the following as a template. Make
   sure you substitute ${NAMESERVER1} and ${NAMESERVER2} with the appropriate
   nameserver addresses:

   Code Listing 27: /etc/resolv.conf template                                 
   nameserver ${NAMESERVER1}                                                  
   nameserver ${NAMESERVER2}                                                  

   That's it. Now test your network by pinging some Internet server (like
   Google). If this works, congratulations then. You are now ready to install
   Gentoo.
