Support non-standard Portage and distfiles locations (requested
by Caleb Cushing)

Add support to targets so they can detect when another metro process
may be building something identical, so metro doesn't try to kill off
the other build.

Grab patch from Benedikt DONE

Clean up fslayout to make it more manageable -- move some stuff into
the gentoo targets themselves to make things cleaner. Simplify the
path definitions. DONE

Add target/type to specify whether something is
a snapshot, a install tarball, or a template. DONE

Use this in combination
with the priority system to define paths.

Add priority option for when and section annotations, so Metro can
choose one based on priority if multiple ones match.

ISO support

add kernel build support (genkernel or raw)

add a way to unmerge things you don't want DONE
(emerge/packages/clean)

, and maybe for Metro 1.4:

add a way to extend steps, so you can have a target-specific "Clean"
as well as a global clean. This should be part of the data model and
may use some kind of OOP or list concept? not quite DONE

allow multi-line references to be expanded into single-line references
with newlines/extra whitespace removed. This way we can have package
lists that look like this:

packages: [
	foo
	bar
	oni
]

A lot easier to maintain and read. Request from Caleb Cushing. DONE

do lastdate with snapshots to avoid creating identical snapshot files
